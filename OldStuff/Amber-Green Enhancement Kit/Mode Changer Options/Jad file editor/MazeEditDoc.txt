MAZEEDITDOC.TXT				May - 30 , 2001 / PM  

MENU:
Is inactive at the moment, the only thing that works is the "Exit" command
in the  "File"-Menu.
Load / Save should work, too, but is fixed to load/save a file named
"level2.maz". The possibilty for an input of the level, that should be
loaded/saved is to be added in the next version.

MAP-VIEW:
In the Map-view window, the right mouse key places a solid wall, and the
left mouse button removes a solid wall (should later put the kind of wall taken
from the menu.

The map is fixed to 32 by 32 tiles. But the code is made this way, that it can
be extendend anytime.

The rectangle under the map view holds the actual window about the camera
position and angle.


KEYS:
The keys are used to move the big Edit-View:

KEYPAD PLUS:   Zoom in
KEYPAD MINUS:  Zoom out
KEYPAD KEY1:   Camera rotate right
KEYPAD KEY3:   Camera rotate left
KEYPAD PERIOD: Switches camera mode between moving camera around viewpoint and
	       turning camer around viewpoint.
               (Doesn't work properly in this version) 	
KEY PAGEUP     Moves the Camera up
KEY PAGEDOWN:  Moves the camera down.


The Camera always rotates around the point in the middle of the big edit view.

The keys that are used in the Map-view
KEYPAD KEY8: Move Edit cursor up
KEYPAD KEY2: Move Edit cursor down
KEYPAD KEY4: Move Edit cursor left
KEYPAD KEY6: Move Edit cursor right

Notice:

There are to stairs as well some animated billboard-rectangles just tho show
some further ideas. The doors in the given example map is for the same intention,
too.

CHANGES FROM VERSION V 0.1 TO V0.11
-----------------------------------

TEXTURE-description file format , Ending "JAT" ("JA"d "T"ecorations)

This files hold the data for wall/bottom textures including measures of the
wal /bottom rectangles.
Positive Z points upward from bottom to top. Bottom of wall and level of bottom
are at Z = 0. The wall has to look to the games NORTH:

Maximum size of a wall is:

Bottom of wall: Z =   0.0
Top of Wall     Z =  92.0
Left:		Y = +64.0
Right:		Y = -64.0
Into the wall:  X = > 0.0 AND <  32.0
Off the wall:	X = < 0.0 AND > -32.0

The textures are internally enumerated as they are read. This number can be used
in walldescriptors. Because of that, the following numbers are standard:
	0: Bottom
        1: Wallside type 1
        2: Wallside type 2
        3: Doorwall (just a dummy)
        4: Stair up
        5: Stair down

Header
"JAD"	-> Any file for jad starts with this three chars
"TXD"	-> It's a texture description.


0x00 0x0B  -> Two Bytes for JAD-Version: Hi version number / Lo version number
	      actual 0 /Binary. Actual Version Number "0.11"
0x00 0x00  -> File size (lo / hi byte)
32 Bytes   Name of texture file, including File-Ending, actually only
	   "BMP"-Files are supported.

           The description itself


0xFF	   --> TEXFILE_CMDCOUNT:
	        Start of a description block. Almost every opengl display-
	       command is supported:
0x00	   --> One byte: Count of commands belonging o this descriptor
	       (max. 16 --> "DISPLAY_MAXCMD")

	   0xFE	-> e.g "TEXFILE_TRIANGLESTRIP"
           0x00	-> Count of vertices belonging to this command.

           	typedef struct {
               	    signed   char x,y,z; /* The vertice itself:  -127..+127 */
               	    unsigned char u,v;	 /* The texture indices: 0..255     */
           	} JADFILEVERTEX;

0xFF       --> End sign
0x00	   --> Zero commands means end of file


Mixed things:
- Second counter for the demo of the implemented time-function.
- Maze size fixed to 32 x 32
- Display function adjusted for new Texture-Description file format
- File loader extended with an example for Texture-Description.

-----------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION V 0.11 TO V0.12
-----------------------------------

Added a menu for the choice between 10 different levels. If a non existing level 
is to be loaded just nothing happens. 

Now, if a key stays pressed, the command is repeated (e. g. if you press the CAMERA-rotate 
button an let it pressed, the 3D-View is rotating.  


- Fixed a bug in displaying stairs (textured data at all).
- Fixed a bug that only the doors looking north were displayed
- Fixed a bug that only the stairs looking north were displayed
 
MenuCode:
  Extended to have at maximum 32 menu-levels. The keys are translated by "jadinput" 
and are handled by the callback given when installing the menu-level.
